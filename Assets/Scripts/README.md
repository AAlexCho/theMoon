README

Design:
This is a 2D Platform game where the user can move around the map using left, right, down, up arrow keys and space bar. 

Character Controller: Character Controller deals with the physics of the character’s movement

Player: Deals with the user’s input

CameraFollow(Camera Controller): Camera follows the main player around the map

Game Controller: Game controller deals with the game’s win and lose situations and checks the time for the timer

-Win situation of this prototype: When the user collects the flower
-Lose situation of this prototype 1: When the user cannot find the flower and the time is up
-Lose situation of this prototype 2: When the user falls into the pit


Known bugs: There is a slight glitch when character jumps and sticks to the side of the tilemap block. We’ll try our best to resolve this issue in our final game.
